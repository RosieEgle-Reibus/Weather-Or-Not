# Onramp iOS Take-Home Project 

## Weather Or Not created by Rose Egle

### Project Summary:

Weather Or Not is a weather app.



## API used
[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/current)

## Model

* CurrentWeatherData.swift -  This is used for parsing the JSON from the API
* CurrentWeatherModel.swift - This sets up the structure of the model that will be created by ViewModel
* HourlyData.swift - This is used for parsing the JSON from the API
* HourlyModel.swift - 
* HourlyArrayModel.swift -

## ViewModel 

* CurrentViewModel.swift - responsible for all asyncchronous networking code, 
* 

## Views

*
*
*



 

* Use of at least 3 [UIViewControllers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller).
* Use of at least one [UIView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview). You can subclass UIView and add subviews to that class.
* The usage of the [MVVM](https://www.raywenderlich.com/34-design-patterns-by-tutorials-mvvm) architectural pattern.
* Use of a [REST API](https://medium.com/@arteko/the-best-way-to-use-rest-apis-in-swift-95e10696c980). We suggest using [Codable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types) for handling JSON.
* Usage of at least 5 UIView/UIControl subclasses (UITableViews, UISegmentedControl, etc).
* The usage of data persistence - UserDefaults, NSKeyedArchiver, or what makes most sense to you. 







 







### Application Description

Each project submission must include a README file providing an overview of the iOS application and details the app's overall MVVM architecture as well as your design decisions. Screenshots of the iOS app taken from the Xcode simulator or your testing device are also required. This task assesses the critical competency of communicating and documenting technical concepts. See details in the submission information section below.


* A description of the overall iOS application
* A high level architectural overview of your iOS application. e.g. names, relationships and purposes of all UIViewControllers and UIViews
* Explanations for and descriptions of the design patterns you leveraged
* [Screenshots](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7092613/take-screenshots-in-the-ios-simulator) of each View and descriptions of the overall user flow
